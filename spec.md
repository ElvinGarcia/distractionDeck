 
 # Overall Project Spec.
  [] The application must be an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend with a Rails API backend.
  [] All interactions between the client and the server must be handled asynchronously (AJAX) and use JSON as the communication format.
  
  [] The JavaScript application must use Object Oriented JavaScript (classes) to encapsulate related data and behavior.

  [] The domain model served by the Rails backend must include a resource with at least one has-many relationship. For example, if you were building an Instagram clone, you might display a list of photos with associated comments.

  [] The backend and frontend must collaborate to demonstrate Client-Server Communication. 
  [] Your application should have at least 3 AJAX calls, covering at least 2 of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD).
  [] Your client-side JavaScript code must use fetch with the appropriate HTTP verb, and your Rails API should use RESTful conventions.

# Javascript
    [ ] Use classes and functions to organize your code into reusable pieces.
    [ ] Translate JSON responses into JavaScript model objects using ES6 class or constructor function syntax.
    [ ] Use ES6 features when appropriate (e.g. arrow functions, let & const, rest and spread syntax).

# Rails 
    [ ] Follow Rails MVC and RESTful conventions. That means, for example, that a request GET /puppies ought to be handled by the PuppiesController, fetch puppies from the database using a Puppy Active Record model, and return a list of puppies as JSON.
    [ ] Well-named variables and methods
    [ ] Short, single-purpose methods

# Git
    [ ] Aim for a large number of small commits - commit frequently!
    [ ] Add meaningful messages to your commits. When you look back at your commits with git log, the messages should describe each change.
    [ ] Don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message

# Project Review
    [ ] Explain your code from execution point to exit point. Use the best technical vocabulary you can.
    [ ] Live code. This could be refactoring, adding a new feature, or both.
    [ ] Answer questions about your knowledge of JavaScript Fundamentals.

    [ ] Explain how Rails routes a request to a controller and method based on the URL and HTTP verb
    [ ] Use render json: to render serialized JSON
    [ ] Select, Create, and Modify DOM nodes
    [ ] Attach listeners to DOM nodes to respond to user interaction
    [ ] Use preventDefault to control form submit behavior
    [ ] Use fetch with 'GET', 'POST', 'PATCH' & 'DELETE' HTTP methods
    [ ] Create a JavaScript object with ES6 class syntax
    [ ] Instantiate JavaScript objects and call methods on them.
